    "section": "Weather",
    "text": "Weather\n\nWind\nIn many other areas, wind tends to have consistent behavior. For example, in the Bozeman MT area, storms often blow in from the West. The mountain ranges there are these isolated, discrete zones, surrounded by plains. This leads to the winds in the mountains also being relatively consistent from the West, throughout the entire forecast zone. Everywhere you go on a single day, the windloading is going to be found on the same aspect.\nOn the other hand, wind is complex in Turnagain Pass. As you travel throughout a day, the prevailing wind might come from many different directions, and many different aspects will be windloaded. Now, even if the wind aspect is inconsistent between different areas at the same time, the wind is often consistent between the same area at different times. For example, the cornice on the ridge of Gold Pan always forms on the same side of the ridge every year, even if maybe a kilometer away the cornices all form on the other side of the ridge.\n\n\nRain\nIt can rain here. It is common for rainline to climb all the way to 3000 feet several times a winter.\nThe magic number to pay attention to is 1000 feet: That is the highest elevation of the road, and often around the elevation you park at. If it’s higher, you can still have good skiing, but you are going to have to pay the toll of climbing through the rain line to get it.\n\n\nSolar input\nThe sun has less effect in Alaska than you might be used to if you are coming from more equatorial areas, and it is less focused. In other areas, in the middle of winter (Dec to Feb), you often need to be aware of how the sun is affecting the snow. Even if it isn’t warming it enough to cause wet slides, it still could be causing melt-freeze crusts, etc. In Turnagain Pass, unless there are exposed rocks to absorb the heat, or it’s a very warm day, I usually don’t think about the solar input that much until the springtime. If it’s a super sunny pow day in January, as long as it’s fairly cold I wouldn’t write off skiing a direct South line.\nThe weak solar input is caused by several things: First, until around the equinox on March 21, Alaska gets fewer hours of daylight than further south. Second, the orbits the horizon instead of arcing straight overhead, which generally leads to any one patch of snow being hit by direct sun for a smaller fraction of the day. Third, it’s a lot cloudier than Colorado.\n\n\nRadiative Cooling\nThe “inverse” of solar input is radiative cooling. This is when the snow emits UV radiation that travels through a clear sky and makes it out to space, taking thermal energy with it. This clear sky is important: on a cloudy day, the UV radiation hits the clouds, the clouds absorb it, the clouds heat up a tiny bit, and then the clouds emit UV radiation of their own, which travels back to the ground, where the snow absorbs it, regaining the energy that they gave away at the beginning. This is similar to on a cold autumn morning when the ground exposed to the sky is frosty, but any ground covered by vegetation or a tent fly is not frosty: both bits of ground emitted the same amount of UV radiation, but the UV from the covered ground got absorbed and re-emitted by the covering object.\nTurnagain Pass often has less radiative cooling effect than other areas, because we are so cloudy.\nRadiative cooling really is important for the corn cycle that happens in the spring. To make corn snow, the top few inches of the snow needs to melt during a warm day, and then freeze solid at night. Around here, because of the moderately warm ambient air temperatures, the freezing at night often requires a clear sky. We can have bad corn seasons when we don’t get those clear skies consitently: the snow melts during the warm day, but then sort of just stays as slop at night.\nTypically, this radiative cooling has the most effect at night, but it can also be significant during a clear day if you are in a shadowy north-facing zone.\n\n\nCommon Patterns\nThere are several common patterns that the weather follows.\n\nGulf Storm\nA storm system comes from the Gulf of Alaska and hits Turnagain Pass from the West, spilling over Portage Pass from Prince William Sound. This is the most common storm system that gives Turnagain Pass snow. When this happens, the areas that are favored for precipitation are Portage (not covered in this guide) and the North end of the Pass. Because this is the most common, this is reason why in general the snowpack is deeper on the North end of the Pass than the South end. These storms can sometimes just sit on Turnagain Pass and DUMP precipitation for 5 days straight.\n\n\nCook Inlet Storms\nThese storms move up Cook Inlet and come over the Kenai Mountains to hit Turnagain Pass from the Southeast. These storms are more rare than the Gulf Storms. When this happens, the Seward and Summit Lake areas (not in this guide) are favored with precipitation, as well as the South end of the pass, where the North end of the pass is skipped.\n\n\nNorthern Outflows\nOftentimes a high pressure system from the center of alaska flows South past Anchorage and down Turnagain Arm, blasting Turnagain Pass with high winds at first, which then settle into a period of clear and cold weather. It’s a bummer when these happen too strongly, because the initial winds can ruin the snow from the previous storm, and then you are stuck with this beautiful weather but a bunch of terrible snow. When this system moves in with less wind, then this pattern can make for excellent riding conditions.",

    "text": "Snowpack and Avalanches\nTurnagain Pass has a maritime snowpack, receiving hundreds of inches of snow (and often, rain) a year.\nThe local avalanche center is CNFAIC (Chugach National Forest Avalanche Information Center).\n\nGround Hoar\nWe don’t usually get it. Hurray! So that means we don’t usually have to worry about avalanches breaking at the ground.\n\n\nGlide Cracks\nWe DO have a hazard that is a lot less common in other zones: glide cracks. This is when the entire snowpack creeps along the ground, and a glide crack appears where sections separate. They are more likely to be active during warm periods and rain, but they can still be active at other times too.\nThey present as a 1-10 foot wide gap in the snowpack that is open all the way to the ground below, which can sometimes be 10 or 15 feet below. This is one hazard of them: if you are careless or if the visibility is bad, you can ski off a non-insignificant temporary cliff!\nThey also are hazards when they release as catastrophic avalanches. This actually is pretty rare, most glide cracks we see become inactive and then new snow fills in the crack. But when they do release, they release usually to the ground, and very large. Usually you can’t trigger them yourself, but you just want to minimize your exposure by not lingering underneath them.\nIn general\n\ntry to avoid them if you can\nbe especially cautious in bad visibility\nif there is no better route, I wouldn’t think it was crazy to quickly scoot around them",

    "text": "Parking\nTincan is the most popular area in Turnagain Pass, and one of the most popular areas in all of Alaska.\nThere is a wide selection of terrain available.\nThere is a pulloff on the East side of the highway, on the outside of a curve. It is one of the better-plowed parking lots in Turnagain pass, usually plowed either during or the day after a storm.\nThis is a dangerous parking lot. In 2021 (???), a semi truck slid off the road and pancaked three cars that were parked in the lot, as Mark Jonas and Bob Dugan were putting on their skins. I try to not linger in the parking lot for very long after I park, and put on my gear near the guardrail where I am at least marginally protected by the parked cars.\nOnce you park, it’s a chaotic scramble/slide down the embankment and across the meadow. On the far side of a meadow, CNFAIC usually has a beacon checker machine. Slide past it one at a time to verify that your beacon is working.\nIf you want a break from downhill skiing, on a clear day it is fun to nordic ski North through these meadows. You go gradually uphill until you reach a crest where you are treated to a beautiful view down the length of the whole of Turnagain Pass, all the way down to Turnagain Arm 1000 feet below. You better watch out though, or you might run into a roving band of retired ladies from Girdwood drinking gin and tonics and eating cake for someone’s birthday.\nVery very rarely is the parking lot so full that there is no room. When this happens, choose a different zone, or continue South up the highway to the Center Ridge parking lot, and you can access the Tincan ridge from the slightly longer and lower quality “Blue Diamond” approach trail.",

You are out of large-scale avalanche terrain the entire time. There are a few small but steep rollovers that I might be concerned about on the highest danger days, but in general it is very safe.

This is the most popular way to deproach Tincan. The benefit of this route is that it allows for slightly better skiing through tin can trees on your last descent; the skiing down the ridge is slightly worse. The downside of this route is that it can be confusing if you don’t know where you are going. Usually you will find a track from others before you, although if it hasn’t snowed recently these tracks can become a maze of people skiing and skinning in all different directions.

There are many complex mini drainages and ridges, so if you are adventurous you can often find less-touched snow if you venture out of the obvious runs. The laps are fairly short, maybe 800 vertical feet, but the uptrack is easy so it doesn’t feel totally stupid.\nIf the weather is stormy, Tincan is one of the better options in Turnagain pass. This area has enough trees to provide visual contrast, where many other areas would be whiteout conditions.\nIt is fairly easy to stay in low angle terrain, out of avalanche terrain, but if you are careless it also is very possible to ski over a small but steep and abrupt rollover and trigger a slide in high avalanche conditions, eg if you are skiing in the middle of a storm. These would be small, but with terrain traps, or if your partners aren’t watching you, it could be serious. On many storm days I have seen small slides triggered in this zone.",
